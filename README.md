# 5minjournal
Recreating the 5 minute journal through HTML, CSS, & JS.

I'm not a journaler/writer but I bought a daily journal to use several years ago. I consistently used it for a few months but would stop and then pick it up here and there once in a blue moon. I enjoyed writing in it, but for whatever reasons, I just couldn't stick to it for a very long time. My goal with this web app is to learn if typing out my thoughts will make it any easier for me to stay committed to it.

I havenâ€™t learned how to work with databases yet, but I want to be able to store each journal entry, retrieve past ones, and look at future dates! I need to figure out how to store an library of motivational quotes and then randomly show daily quotes from that array. 

This is a good project for me to take on because it will demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, MongoDB, and of course, using GitHub and vc. 

This is going to be a fun learning project and I hope to share this with everyone, writers and non-writers alike! I really think taking a few minutes a day to journal is a great way to add some positivity to your day.
